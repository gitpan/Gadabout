Gadabout 1.0
=========================

Gadabout is a perl reimplementation based on Vagrant:
http://vagrant.sourceforge.net/

The entire code was rewritten in perl.  Some verbatim translation and
some reimplementation from scratch of the parts that were broken.

It has a mod_perl handler for Pie charts, but is remarkably easy to
use to generate very slick looking graphs.

Ben Martin <bmartin@omniti.com> did the Gadabout and Gadabout::Imlib2 coding.
Theo Schlossnagle <jesus@omniti.com> did the Gadabout::Pie coding, testing,
debugging, and packaging for release.
